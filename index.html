                <p>Grant Thornton helps clients structure their cloud governance processes so they can maintain control over cloud resource usage, visibility, and policy enforcement as their cloud accounts and cloud usage grows. Grant Thornton helps clients set up and govern and secure multi-account AWS environments by establishing a landing zone that is based on best-practices blueprints, and enables governance using guardrails. Through this service, Grant Thornton automates the creation of a landing zone with best-practices blueprints that configure AWS Organizations for a multi-account structure, provide identity management using AWS SSO Directory, provide federated access using AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO), create a central log archive using AWS CloudTrail and AWS Config, enable security audits across accounts using AWS SSO, implement network configurations using Amazon VPC, and define workflows for provisioning accounts using AWS Service Catalog. As part of this service, Grant Thornton also helps clients establish “guardrails” for ongoing governance of their AWS environment. Guardrails provide governance controls by preventing deployment of resources that don’t conform to selected policies or detecting non-conformance of provisioned resources. Guardrails are implemented using services, such as AWS CloudFormation to establish a baseline, AWS Organizations service control policies (SCPs) to prevent configuration changes, and AWS Config rules to continuously detect non-conformance. To deliver this service, Grant Thornton uses (1) AWS Control Tower to implement pre-defined blueprints and guardrails to help customers implement a landing zone for new AWS accounts, or (2) AWS Control Tower to provide a fully configurable, customer-managed landing zone implementation. </p>

                <p>Grant Thornton helps clients execute the Assessment and Authorization (A&A) security authorization process for cloud workloads. This service is delivered through collaboration between professionals within the Grant Thornton Public Sector Risk, Information Assurance and Cloud teams. Grant Thornton helps clients secure official management decision to authorize operation of cloud-based workloads and to secure explicit acceptance of risk to agency operations (including mission, functions, image, or reputation), agency assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of an agreed-upon set of security and privacy controls and common controls inherited from the cloud platform. As part of this service, Grant Thornton helps clients secure (a) Interim ATO - a conditional ATO, generally in effect for six months, often during the development or prototype; (b) Initial ATO - must be done prior to the workload going live and must occur at least every three years thereafter; (c) Reauthorization - due after three years or a significant change to the system's risk level. Grant Thornton provides this service for FISMA reportable systems, including general support systems (GSS), financial reporting systems, and major applications (MA).  Grant Thornton follows the six step ATO security authorization process defined in the NIST Risk Management Framework (categorize, select, implement, assess, authorize, and monitor). When delivering this service, Grant Thornton considers 18 control families (e.g. access control, audit and accountability, personnel security, media protection) within three control classes (e.g. management, operational, technical), as defined within NIST RMF and related standards, including NIST SP 800-(37, 53, 60, 137) and FIPS 199 and 200.</p>
